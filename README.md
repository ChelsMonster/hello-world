# hello-world
My first GitHub experience. 
My name is Chelsea, but my BJJ coach calls the the ChelsMonster. Either works for me. I want to train BJJ and MMA full time so I am trying to learn some more coding to get a second job. I would love to work for a start-up with other smart and interesting people. Wish me luck!
